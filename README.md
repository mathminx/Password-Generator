Module 3 Challenge - Password Generator

## Description
I built this application to enable employees to generate strong passwords that provide greater security. The application creates random passwords based on criteria chosen by the employees from the options presented to them by the application.. This app runs in the browser, and is powered by JavaScript code that I wrote, which dynamically updates HTML and CSS. The application utilises a responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.

## Installation
The project is deployed via GitHub Pages.

## Usage:
User clicks the button to generate a password
User is prompted for the length of the password
User chooses a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
User is presented with a series of prompts for selecting password criteria: lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and special characters
For each criteria prompt, the user selects whether or not to include the character type in the password
For each criteria prompt, the userâ€™s input is validated
After all prompts have been answered, the user input is validated to ensure that at least one character type has been selected
Once the input has passed validation, a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
The password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
